            <h1>Facts About Ants</h1>

            <p>
              Ants are incredibly strong, capable of lifting objects up to 50 times their own body weight, and they live
              in highly organized colonies with a clear division of labor, including roles such as workers, soldiers,
              and queens. They communicate using chemicals called pheromones, which they use to leave trails for other
              ants to follow, and there are over 12,000 species of ants found on every continent except Antarctica. Some
              ant species form mutualistic relationships with plants and other insects, providing protection in exchange
              for food, and despite their small size, ants play a crucial role in the ecosystem by aiding in soil
              aeration and decomposition
