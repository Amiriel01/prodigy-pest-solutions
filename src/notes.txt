5/4 

work on placing the animated images in certain sections, 

check the site and see where the images can fit,


first I see the payment plan section, 

see if you can place the animated image in row with the rest of the content, 

use animated image in meet the team section, the one in the row with payment looks good 

change the img in the meet the team section, 



// adjust the images before the footer, see if you can find a new first image 


// start making the navbar responsive and go through each section 

making it responsive and polishing 

make the navbar icons bigger, that should take care of the responsiveness, 

 remove previous media query styles and start the media querys over, 


 why is the search icon going away, when the navbar button container is removed


 try to center the container 





 // working on making the testiomonial section responsive 

 // I think the current approach won't work, the img within the carousel 
 // is a certain size, it can't shrink too much the user will not be able to read CFA
 // you cannot import images because they will have a fixed width and you cannot adjust them 

 // write the content within the carousel 

 // there will be no other way to make it responsive
