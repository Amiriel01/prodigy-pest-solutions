5/4 

work on placing the animated images in certain sections, 

check the site and see where the images can fit,


first I see the payment plan section, 

see if you can place the animated image in row with the rest of the content, 

use animated image in meet the team section, the one in the row with payment looks good 

change the img in the meet the team section, 



// adjust the images before the footer, see if you can find a new first image
